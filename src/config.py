config.py

This module defines the configuration management for the application. It retrieves essential configuration parameters from environment variables and sets defaults where necessary. 

Classes:
- config: A class responsible for loading and holding configuration settings used across the application.

Attributes:
- openai_api_key: API key for authenticating with the OpenAI services, must be available in environment variables.
- active_assistant_id: Identifier for the active assistant used for operations involving assistant capabilities.

Raises:
- AssertionError: If the 'openai_api_key' cannot be retrieved from environment variables.

The 'cfg' instance of the 'config' class is created at the module level for global access to configurations.
