"""Module for testing utility functions related to directory operations, file management, command execution, and docstring reading.

This script contains test functions for the following utilities:
- `build_directory_tree`: Constructs and returns a directory tree structure.
- `delete_file`: Deletes a specified file from the file system.
- `execute_command`: Executes a command in the specified directory.
- `read_docstring`: Reads and returns the docstring from a specified Python file.

Notable dependencies include:
- `os`: Used for interacting with the operating system, particularly for getting the current working directory.
- `unittest.mock.patch`: Utilized for mocking user input during testing.
- Utility functions imported from the `src.tools` package:
  - `build_directory_tree`
  - `delete_file`
  - `execute_command`
  - `read_docstring`

Each function is tested for basic functionality and error handling. The script can be executed directly to run all tests."""
